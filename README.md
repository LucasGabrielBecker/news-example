# Simple case with react js consuming and showing a list of articles or stuffs

It is a public api btw

#### Cool thing to notice

Implemented a kind of 'caching' system with localStorage, that prevents the application for making several requests looking for the same data;
If the url has already been requested, it means that the return will probably be the same, then use the cached version;
Otherwise, make the request
